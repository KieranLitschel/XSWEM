# XSWEM

A simple and explainable deep learning model for NLP.

Based on SWEM-max as proposed by Shen et al. in [Baseline Needs More Love: On Simple Word-Embedding-Based Models and Associated Pooling Mechanisms, 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09843.pdf).

This package is currently in development, more details will be provided further into development. We plan to implement the global intepretation method proposed in section 4.1.1 of the original paper, and also some local interpretation methods we have developed.
